## Customize

I decided to use Meteor for its real-time nature and ability to organize server and client side JavaScript in the same file.

Every "widget" on the screen can be found in the [`./widgets`](https://github.com/lambtron/homemirror/tree/master/widgets) folder. Let's look at the [`time`](https://github.com/lambtron/homemirror/tree/master/widgets/time) widget as an example:

1. Create the folder `time` with `./time/index.html` and `./time/index.js`

2. Define the `time` template in [`index.html`](https://github.com/lambtron/homemirror/blob/master/widgets/time/index.html)

    ```
    <template name="time">
      <div style="font-size: 3em">
        {{time}}
      </div>
    </template>
    ```

3. Define the logic for rendering the `time` template in [`index.js`](https://github.com/lambtron/homemirror/blob/master/widgets/time/index.js)

    ```
    if (Meteor.isClient) {
      Template.time.helpers({
        time: function() {
          return Chronos.liveMoment().format("hh:mma");
        }
      });
    }
    ```

4. Add the `time` template to [`./client/index.html`](https://github.com/lambtron/homemirror/blob/master/client/index.html#L7)

    ```
    <head>
      <title>Mirror</title>
    </head>

    <body>
      {{> date}}
      {{> time}}
      {{> weather}}
      {{> news}}
    </body>
    ```

Have fun!

## Hardware

I followed [Hannah's guide](https://github.com/HannahMitt/HomeMirror) pretty closely.

### Items

- 12 inch by 18 inch by 1/8 inch two way mirror from [TAP Plastics](http://www.tapplastics.com/product/plastics/cut_to_size_plastic/two_way_mirrored_acrylic/558)
- 7 inch used Samsung Galaxy Tab
- [12 inch by 18 inch black construction paper, 50 sheets](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F7ASAU)
- [Two-sided adhesive strips](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0084M68IO)
- [3M General Purpose 4S Spray Adhesive](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PCWRMC)

### Directions

#### 1. Cut a hole in the black construction paper for the device's viewport

Make sure the size of the hole that you are cutting is the size of the device's _viewport_ and not the size of the device itself. You're going to put the two-sided adhesives along the edge of the construction paper that will stick to the device's bevel.

#### 2. Glue the construction paper onto the back of the mirror

Use the spray adhesive at about 6-8 inches away from the construction paper. Don't get the construction paper too wet. After several seconds, slowly stick the sprayed side onto the back side of the mirror.

#### 3. Add adhesive strips to the back of the construction paper around the edge of the device's viewport cutout

#### 4. Set the device up.. last chance to touch your device!

The two (free) apps I needed to download were:
- [Stay Alive!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.synetics.stay.alive&hl=en): for preventing the device from sleeping
- [Kiosk Browser](http://appcrawlr.com/android/kiosk-browser-2): so that you can set the browser to the Home Mirror web app in full screen mode (probably not even necessary, but this is my first Android device and I struggled with even the most basic navigation)

Set the Kiosk Browser to point to your Home Mirror web app domain.

#### 5. Stick the device onto the two-way adhesive strips

Voila!
